Project Overview: SQL AI Query Bot & EDA Agent

This project is a dual-purpose AI application that allows users to:
Chat with a SQL Database: Convert natural language questions into SQL queries.
Analyze CSV Files (EDA): Upload datasets and have an AI write Python code to analyze and plot data.
It is built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, using Google Gemini as the intelligence layer.-----📂 Project Structure & File Guide

Here is a detailed breakdown of the files and folders:

1. Root Directory
File/Folder
Description
README.md
The instruction manual. It tells you how to set up the project (install dependencies, set up database, run servers) and what the features are.
.gitignore
Tells Git which files to ignore (not track). It lists things like venv (virtual environment), .env (secrets), __pycache__ (compiled python files), and node_modules (frontend dependencies).
data.csv
A sample dataset (Bank Marketing data) provided to test the "EDA Agent" feature. You can upload this to the app to ask questions like "Plot the age distribution".

2. Backend (/backend)

This contains all the Python code for the server and AI logic.

SQL Execution Flow Document

This document details the step-by-step code execution for three common SQL Agent scenarios.

Core File: backend/app/agent.py
Entry Point: backend/app/main.py -> chat() endpoint-----1. Scenario: Create or Delete a Table

User Prompt: "Create a table named 'employees' with columns id and name"Execution Flow
Stage
File/Function
Action/Description
API Request
 backend/app/main.py: chat(request: ChatRequest)
Receives the POST request, extracts message ("Create a table..."), connects to DB, and calls get_agent_response.
Agent Initialization
 backend/app/agent.py: get_agent_response(...)
Initializes ChatGoogleGenerativeAI (LLM) and SQLDatabase (db connection). Calls get_schema_info to understand the current state of the DB.
Stage 1: The Planner (Generating SQL)
 backend/app/agent.py: planner_stage(...)
Constructs a big text prompt ("You are a SQL Expert...", User Goal, Database Schema). Sends this to Google Gemini models.


 Generated Output (Internal JSON)
json\n{\n "plan_description": "Create employees table",\n "queries": ["CREATE TABLE employees (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100))"]\n}
Stage 2: The Executor (Running SQL)
 backend/app/agent.py: executor_stage(db, plan)
Loops through queries. Includes a Safety Check for protected tables (chat_sessions, chat_messages). Executes: db.run(query).


 Result
"Success" (or an empty string indicating the command ran).
Stage 3: The Responder (Explaining Results)
 backend/app/agent.py: responder_stage(...)
Constructs a prompt with the User Question and Execution Log. Asks Gemini to explain what happened.


 Result
"I have successfully created the 'employees' table with columns id and name."

-----2. Scenario: Reading the DB (Listing Tables)

User Prompt: "What tables are in the database?"Execution Flow
Stage
File/Function
Action/Description
Context Loading (The "Reading" Part)
backend/app/agent.py: get_schema_info(db)
Before every request, the agent inspects the database. Calls db.get_usable_table_names() and formats it into a string (e.g., Table: students\nTable: chat_sessions...). This schema is injected into the Planner's prompt.
Stage 1: The Planner
planner_stage(...)
The prompt includes the schema info. The LLM generates a metadata query (Option A) or, less commonly, answers directly (Option B).


Generated Output (Option A)
The LLM generates a metadata query: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public'.
Stage 2 & 3: Executor & Responder
executor_stage / responder_stage
Executor runs the SELECT query. Responder reads the list of tables returned (e.g., [('students',), ('employees',)]) and lists them for the user.

-----3. Scenario: Modify/Query Existing Table

User Prompt: "Add a student named 'Alice' to the students table"Execution Flow
Stage
File/Function
Action/Description
Stage 1: The Planner
planner_stage(...)
The schema_info in the prompt indicates the students table columns (e.g., name, class, section, marks). The LLM infers missing values or generates a specific INSERT.


Generated Output
json\n{\n "queries": ["INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('Alice')"]\n}
Stage 2: The Executor
executor_stage(db, plan)
Executes db.run("INSERT INTO students..."). The new row is added to the database.
Stage 3: The Responder
responder_stage(...)
Receives the execution log showing "Success". Generates text: "Added Alice to the students table."

Note on "Files Generated"
SQL Agent: This flow does not generate any files on your disk. It simply reads/writes to the PostgreSQL database.
EDA Agent (different flow): If you were using the EDA Agent (for CSV analysis), it would generate Python files and PNG plots in backend/workspace/plots. This is handled by eda_agent.py, not the SQL flow described above.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Execution Flow

This document details the step-by-step code execution for the EDA Agent (CSV analysis).-----Core File: backend/app/eda\_agent.py

Entry Point: backend/app/main.py -> eda\_chat() endpoint-----1. Scenario: Uploading a CSV File

User Action: Drag and drop a CSV file (e.g., data.csv) in the UI.
Step
File/Function
Action
Result/Location
API Request
 backend/app/main.py: upload\_csv(file: UploadFile)
Receives file stream. Generates a unique UUID filename (e.g., 1234-abcd.csv).
-
File Generation (Saving)
 -
Server writes actual file content to disk.
backend/workspace/uploads/1234-abcd.csv
Preview Generation
 -
Reads the first 5 rows using pandas.
Returns JSON with filename (UUID), columns, and preview data to the frontend.

-----2. Scenario: Analyzing Data (Plotting/Querying)

User Prompt: "Plot the distribution of age as a histogram"
Step
File/Function
Action
API Request
backend/app/main.py: eda\_chat(request: EdaChatRequest)
Payload contains message, filename (UUID from step 1), and history. Calls get\_eda\_response(...).
Data Loading
backend/app/eda\_agent.py: get\_eda\_response(...)
Locates file at workspace/uploads/<filename>. Loads into a Pandas DataFrame (df = pd.read\_csv(...)). Captures df.info() and df.head() to create a "Dataframe Info" summary for the LLM.

Stage 1: The Planner (Generating Python Code)
File/Function
Action
Generated Output (Internal)
backend/app/eda\_agent.py: planner\_stage(...)
Constructs a prompt for Gemini: "You are a Python Data Analysis Expert... Dataframe Info: [columns, types]... User Goal: Plot age...". Asks Gemini to write Python Code.
python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.histplot(df['age'], kde=True)\nplt.title('Age Distribution')\nplt.savefig('age\_hist.png') # Crucial: Saves the plot to disk!\nplt.clf()\nprint("Plotted the distribution of age.")\n

Stage 2: The Executor (Running Python & Creating Files)
File/Function
Action
Result/Location
backend/app/eda\_agent.py: executor\_stage(code, df)
 Creates a secure Temporary Directory. Executes the generated Python code using exec() with the df variable passed in.
-
File Generation
 -
The executed code generates PNG files (e.g., age\_hist.png) in the temp directory.
Processing Results
 -
Captures stdout (any print() output). Scans the temp directory for any .png files created.
Moving Files
 -
Renames images to unique UUIDs (e.g., plot\_xyz123.png) and moves them.
Result Update
 -
Updates the result object with the web-accessible path.

Stage 3: The Responder (Explaining Results)
File/Function
Action
Result
backend/app/eda\_agent.py: responder\_stage(...)
Takes the stdout and the fact that plots were generated. Asks Gemini to write a friendly response.
"I have generated a histogram showing the distribution of age. You can see the plot below."

LangChain Usage Analysis

LangChain is used as the orchestration framework to connect the LLM (Google Gemini) with your data (SQL Database and CSV files).

Here is exactly where and how it is used in your codebase:1. Google Gemini Integration (The "Brain")

Component: ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
Package: langchain_google_genai

This is the wrapper that allows LangChain to talk to Google's Gemini models.

Used in:
backend/app/agent.py (SQL Agent)
# Line 165
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model=os.getenv("GEMINI_MODEL", "gemini-1.5-flash"),
    google_api_key=google_api_key,
    temperature=0
)
backend/app/eda_agent.py (EDA Agent)
# Line 170
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model=os.getenv("GEMINI_MODEL", "gemini-1.5-flash"),
    google_api_key=google_api_key,
    temperature=0
)
Purpose: To send prompts to Gemini and get text responses back. The temperature=0 setting ensures the AI is deterministic (less creative, more precise), which is cleaner for generating code/SQL.2. SQL Database Tools (The "connector")

Component: SQLDatabase
Package: langchain_community.utilities

This provides a unified way to interact with SQL databases, abstracting away the underlying driver (PostgreSQL vs MySQL etc).

Used in:
backend/app/agent.py
# Line 174
db = SQLDatabase(engine)
Key Functions Used:
db.get_usable_table_names(): Fetches list of tables (Step 1 of execution).
db.get_table_info(): Dumps the CREATE TABLE schema text (Step 1 of execution).
db.run(query): Executes the SQL query generated by the AI (Step 2 of execution).
3. Prompt Management (Implicit)

While you aren't using LangChain's PromptTemplate class explicitly (you are using f-strings), you are following the LangChain pattern of "Chains" manually.

Manual Chaining in agent.py:
Context Construction: Getting schema_info from the SQLDatabase tool.
Prompt 1 (Planner): Sending Schema + User Query to LLM -> Get SQL.
Action: Executing SQL.
Prompt 2 (Responder): Sending SQL Results + User Query to LLM -> Get Answer.
Summary Table

LangChain Component
Purpose
 backend/app/agent.py
 ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
The Intelligence: Generates SQL and text answers.
 backend/app/agent.py
 SQLDatabase
The Tool: Reads schema metadata and runs queries.
 backend/app/eda_agent.py
 ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
The Intelligence: Generates Python code for CSV analysis.

Note on requirements.txt: You have langchain-experimental installed but it acts as an unused dependency in the current code. It is often used for create_pandas_dataframe_agent, but your project implements a custom EDA agent (backend/app/eda_agent.py) instead of using the out-of-the-box LangChain one. This gives you more control over the plotting and file saving mechanism.
